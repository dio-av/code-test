## Problem to be solved

A mobile operator has several plans offered in its catalog. When you buy a smartphone, you can choose one of the plans offered for it. 
Your application should be able to filter and sort these plans according to some pre-established business rules:

1.	The plan can only be offered once, i.e. it cannot appear more than once in your return list.
2.	The start date of the plan must be greater than the current date.
3.	The plan with the highest priority must be chosen, with 1 being considered the highest priority and (n+1) the lowest priority.
4.	The return list must show all the fields in the plan.
